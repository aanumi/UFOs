# WRITTEN ANALYSIS - UFO SIGHTINGS

## OVERVIEW
The purpose of this project is to help Dana create an interactive webpage that allows readers parse through data around UFO sightings. The webpage will show an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by letting users filter for multiple criteria regarding UFO sightings at once. We will use multiple filter criteria such as state, city, country, shape, etc. to help users filter through and find results.

## RESULTS
The webpage built allows the user to filter for different UFO sightings by letting them enter different city, country, state, etc for the UFO sighting they seek to find. A user can enter values in the search fields for city, state, country, shape, and date to find specific UFO sightings. Images of the search filter fields can be seen below:

## SUMMARY
### DESIGN DRAWBACK
One drawback of this design is the likelihood of case sensitivity - which may cut out some results that would otherwise have been relevant to the user of the webpage. A modification of the search term by using lowercase letters will likely not return any values, which is misleading as the data for the state or city could exist on the webpage. 

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DEVELOPMENT
•	One recommendation for further development might be to insert a grayed out message (that doesn’t hinder the search function) to inform users that the items are case-sensitive. This will instruct and direct them on correctly and successfully using the correct case for searches.
  
  •	A second recommendation is to modify the code to allow for lower/upper-case variants of the same values in the search field. This will return more relevant results, and the user is likely to find the answer they seek sooner.
